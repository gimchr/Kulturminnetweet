# Kulturminnetweet
This is a simple python code for passing tweets to the handle @TweetMinne. Please feel free to reuse or improve.
The app uses the open REST API of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway and the open "kommunenummer" API of Statistics Norway.
Twython (https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) must be installed for the script to work, and all "insert"s must be replaced.
